Ion
===
Ion is an example Web(HTTP) Server developed in java by Kostas "souperk" Alexopoulos (kostas@alcinia.net).

It uses Apache Commons Configuration, Apache Commons IO, Apache Commons Lang(2.6), Apache Commons Logging, Apache log4j, Apache commons Collections libraries.

Current release is 1.3.0 .

Feutures
===

Currently Ion functions both as an http server and as a proxy to another http server.

As an http server Ion doesn't support any known web language like php and javascript thought thankfully browsers recognise on their own the html files.

Also currently Ion recognises only the Host header of the http protocol. However next major release (1.4.0) will aim for compability with more http headers.

Name

Getting Started
